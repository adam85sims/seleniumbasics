<h2>Put it all together</h2>

<p>Now you've got a decent idea of how to run some specific functions in Selenium. If you've been folowing along, you have looked at:</p>

<ul>
<li>Opening the browser</li>
<li>Maximizing the browser</li>
<li>Finding elements with XPATH and CSS selectors</li>
<li>Clicking</li>
<li>Navigating pages</li>
<li>Adding text to input elements</li>
<li>Implicit and explicit waits</li>
<li>Getting pass or fail feedback from the console</li>
<li>Scraping information from pages</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a great starting point for you in learning Selenium Webdriver and automated testing. But we have only really concentrated on W3Schools. Don't worry, I've got you covered! Here's a project. I want you to write your own script with the information I have provided you with and:</p>

<ul>
<li>Navigate to (URL TO COME)</li>
<li>Get the page title</li>
<li>Navigate to Selenium Basics Course</li>
<li>Select the contact form</li>
<li>Confirm that the page title is "Selenium Basics Course - Contact"</li>
<li>Fill in the contact form</li>
<li>Hit send</li>
<li>Output in your console if this has been sucessful</li>
</ul>

<p>With what we have covered in this course, this shouldn't be a problem for you. If however you do have trouble, use Google and find the answer. The reason I chose Java for this basic course is because although there is no 'standard' for engineers using WebDriver, Java is the most widely used. Finding an answer shouldn't be a problem.</p>

<h2>Nice one! That'll wrap things up for the basics course. If you filled in the form in the last task, I'll let you know when I've got some more advanced material ready.</h2>
